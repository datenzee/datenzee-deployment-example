# Datenzee Deployment Example

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/DSW%20Version-3.19.0-blue.svg)

:exclamation: This example is intended for **local setup and testing**. For production use there are many more things to do such as authentication, controlling exposed ports (e.g. do not expose ports of `postgres` and `minio`), data backups, or using proxy (with HTTPS and WebSocket enabled).
